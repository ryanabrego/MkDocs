
This section outlines how our documentation team operates within Agile and DevOps environments to deliver high-quality, timely content in sync with the software development lifecycle.

## Agile Integration
Our team is fully integrated into the Agile process, working alongside developers, product managers, and QA teams. Writers participate in daily standups, sprint planning, backlog grooming, and retrospectives to ensure documentation is treated as a core deliverableâ€”not an afterthought.

Documentation work is tracked as user stories or tasks within the sprint board, giving it visibility and ensuring alignment with product milestones.

## Docs-as-Code Workflow
We follow a docs-as-code model, authoring all content in Markdown and managing it in Git repositories. Writers and SMEs submit changes through pull requests, enabling collaborative editing, version control, and transparent documentation history. 

Our CI/CD pipelines handle automated builds and deploy documentation updates alongside code, ensuring end users always have access to the latest information.

## Continuous Delivery and Feedback
We release documentation iteratively, using the same cadence as our software development teams. This allows us to respond quickly to changes in functionality, UI, or user feedback. Writers collaborate closely with cross-functional teams to ensure documentation evolves alongside the product.

By embedding writing into the Agile and DevOps culture, we ensure that content remains relevant, actionable, and closely tied to user needs.
