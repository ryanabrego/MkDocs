Our content strategy is built to scale with product complexity and user needs. It ensures that technical documentation is clear, discoverable, and aligned with business goals, while keeping pace with agile development and modern DevOps workflows.

## Audience-First Approach
We design documentation with a deep understanding of our target audiences, including system administrators, developers, DevOps engineers, and end users. Each content type, from quickstarts and how-to guides to API references and troubleshooting topics, is tailored to the user's journey and level of expertise.

We rely on user personas, support feedback, and analytics to prioritize high-impact content that reduces friction and improves adoption.

## Information Architecture
Our documentation is structured for easy navigation and scalability. We use topic-based authoring to break down complex systems into modular, reusable chunks. Content is organized around user workflows and product functionality, not internal team structures.

We apply consistent taxonomy, metadata, and tagging to improve searchability and ensure users can quickly find the information they need.

## Content Planning and Prioritization
Content roadmaps are developed in coordination with product management, UX, support, and engineering. We prioritize documentation deliverables based on product releases, feature complexity, and customer impact.

By aligning documentation sprints with product timelines, we ensure content is delivered just-in-time for go-to-market efforts and in-product integrations.

## Collaboration and Governance
Our strategy emphasizes cross-functional collaboration. Writers work closely with engineers, PMs, and designers throughout the development cycle. Documentation tickets are included in Jira (or similar tools), and writing is embedded in agile workflows.

We also establish clear governance for content lifecycle management, including tracking versions, deprecations, and ownership to maintain accuracy and consistency over time.

## Tooling and Delivery
We use a docs-as-code toolchain built on GitHub, Markdown, and MkDocs, enabling continuous publishing, automated builds, and integration with CI/CD pipelines. This allows us to scale content delivery efficiently and maintain parity between code and documentation releases.
