# Docs-as-Code Projects

I built this site using Markdown for content, GitHub and Git Bash for version control and deployment, and MkDocs for static site generation. This Docs-as-Code model enables me to update content and publish to a static site without relying on a formal publishing process. In addition, I can incorporate automation using Python to automate editing and syntax checking. See https://ryanabrego.github.io/MkDocs/portfolio/python/ for more information on that subject.
