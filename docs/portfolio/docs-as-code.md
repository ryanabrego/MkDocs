# Docs-as-Code Projects

I built this site using Markdown for content, GitHub and Git Bash for version control and deployment, and MkDocs for static site generation. This Docs-as-Code model enables me to collaborate with subject matter experts and stakeholders in the code repository, and update content and publish to a static site without the complexity or licensing barriers of a traditional content management system. 

These sites can be used for user guides, API documentation, reference manuals, and internal developer documentation. In addition, I can use Python to automate editing and publishing. See https://ryanabrego.github.io/MkDocs/portfolio/python/ for more information on that subject.
