# Docs-as-Code Projects

Documentation using a Docs-as-Code model use Markdown for content, GitHub and Git Bash for version control and deployment, and MkDocs for static site generation. This model enables writers to collaborate with subject matter experts and stakeholders in the code repository, and update content and publish to a static site without the complexity or licensing barriers of a traditional content management system. 

These sites can be used for user guides, API documentation, reference manuals, and internal developer documentation. In addition, writers can use Python to automate quality assurance and publishing. See [Python & Automation](python.md) for more information.
