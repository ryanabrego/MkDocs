Docs-as-Code refers to a documentation model of content creation, file management, and publishing system that uses a plain text editor, a version control tool, and a static site generator. In a docs-as-code model, content is treated like code: versioned, reviewed, tested, and deployed automatically. These projects reflect our commitment to scalable, maintainable, and developer-friendly documentation.

## Philosophy and Approach
Docs-as-code is more than just a toolset; it is a mindset. By applying software development best practices to documentation, we ensure:

* Transparency through Git-based version control

* Collaboration through pull requests and structured reviews

* Consistency using automated linting and formatting checks

* Agility with CI/CD pipelines that support rapid publishing

* Reusability by building modular, topic-based content

This model enables technical writers to work alongside developers in the same environment, which improves efficiency and alignment.

## Featured Projects
Developer Portal
A comprehensive developer hub for internal and external APIs, built with MkDocs and hosted on GitHub Pages. Key features include:

* OpenAPI-based endpoint references

* Code samples in multiple languages

* Automated deployments using GitHub Actions

* Versioned documentation aligned with each API release

## Product Onboarding Guide
An interactive onboarding experience for enterprise customers, built with Docusaurus. The project includes:

* Step-by-step walkthroughs for new users

* Interactive code snippets and example use cases

* Embedded videos and in-product links

## Internal Knowledge Base
A living documentation site for engineering, DevOps, and support teams, created with MkDocs Material. Features include:

* Role-based navigation for different teams

* Tagging and search filters for quick discovery

* Automated checks for link validity and formatting

* Feedback mechanisms integrated with GitHub Discussions

## Tooling Stack
Most projects are powered by a modern documentation toolchain, which includes:

* Markdown and YAML for content and configuration

* GitHub or GitLab for version control and team collaboration

* MkDocs or Docusaurus for static site generation

* CI/CD tools such as GitHub Actions or Jenkins for deployment

* Vale and markdownlint to enforce style and formatting

* OpenAPI or Swagger for structured API documentation

## Collaboration and Workflow
Documentation lives in the same repositories as the product code. Writers participate in early feature discussions and continue through the release process. Every change is tracked through pull requests and reviewed by peers or subject matter experts. CI pipelines automatically build and deploy updates, ensuring fast and reliable content delivery.
