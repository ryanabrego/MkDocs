# Docs-as-Code Projects

Docs-as-Code refers to a documentation model of content creation, file management, and publishing system that uses a plain text editor, a version control tool, and a static site generator. This site uses Markdown for content, GitHub and Git Bash for version control and deployment, and MkDocs for static site generation. This model enables writers to collaborate with subject matter experts and stakeholders in the code repository, and update content and publish to a static site without the complexity or licensing barriers of a traditional content management system. 

Docs-as-code sites can be used for user guides, API documentation, reference manuals, and internal developer documentation. In addition, you can use Python and AI to build site features and enhancements, such as automating quality assurance and publishing. See [Python & Automation](python.md) for more information.
