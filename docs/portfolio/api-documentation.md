Clear, accurate API documentation is essential for driving developer adoption, reducing support overhead, and enabling integration at scale. Our approach to API documentation combines technical precision with developer empathy, leveraging modern tooling and best practices throughout the content lifecycle.

## Developer-Centric Design
API documentation is written with the developer experience in mind. We focus on delivering actionable, example-driven content that helps users understand how to authenticate, make requests, and handle responses with minimal ramp-up time.

Each endpoint is documented with request/response syntax, parameter descriptions, HTTP status codes, and real-world examples. Where possible, we include code samples in multiple languages to support a broad developer audience.

## Source of Truth
API documentation is tightly coupled with the source code and specifications to ensure consistency and accuracy. We use OpenAPI (Swagger) definitions as the single source of truth, generating reference documentation and supplementing it with human-authored guides, tutorials, and conceptual overviews.

Versioning is managed through Git, and documentation is updated in sync with each release to reflect new endpoints, deprecated functionality, or breaking changes.

## Documentation Types
Our API documentation includes a full range of content types to support different stages of the developer journey:

* **Getting Started Guides**: Walkthroughs for authentication, environment setup, and first API calls

* **Endpoint References**: Auto-generated or hand-curated descriptions of every endpoint, including methods, headers, and schema

* **Use Case Guides**: Step-by-step examples for common workflows and integrations

* **Error Handling**: Explanation of error codes, common pitfalls, and troubleshooting steps

* **Changelogs and Release Notes**: Timely updates to help developers stay informed about API changes

## Tooling and Workflow
We follow a docs-as-code approach to maintain API documentation in Markdown or reStructuredText, often integrating with OpenAPI specs via tools like:

* Swagger UI or Redoc for rendering

* MkDocs plugins for schema inclusion

* CI pipelines to validate specs and deploy changes automatically

Documentation lives alongside code in GitHub, enabling version control, peer review, and continuous delivery.

## Collaboration and Accuracy
Writers work closely with backend engineers and product managers to ensure documentation reflects actual functionality. API changes are communicated via pull requests, changelogs, and API design reviews, allowing writers to update documentation in parallel with development.
