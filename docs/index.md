## From Words to Workflows: The Story of Ryan Abrego and the Docs-as-Code Revolution

Ryan Abrego wasn’t always obsessed with YAML, Git branches, and Markdown files. But after more than 20 years in the world of technical writing, guiding SaaS and enterprise software teams, and building high-performing content teams, he saw a transformation coming—and he leaned in.

Based in West Chester, Pennsylvania, Ryan had already established himself as a seasoned Technical Writing Manager. He wasn’t just a content creator; he was a mentor, a strategist, and a bridge between engineering, product, and customer success. He led remote documentation teams with agility, aligning deliverables with roadmaps and measuring success with clarity.

But in 2024, he began crafting something new. He envisioned a training course for technical writers to learn Python—not just as a side skill, but as a tool to better understand APIs, build documentation generators, and truly embed in engineering workflows. He built it from the ground up, combining code comprehension, Sphinx, MkDocs, and real-world GitHub workflows. For Ryan, it wasn’t about just writing about software—it was about writing with software.

He brought his personal GitHub to life. One repo, aptly named “MkDocs,” became his lab. He created markdown files, linked them into a live site, and configured mkdocs.yml by hand—learning by doing, teaching by showing. He ran git status like a daily mantra and edited in nano like an old-school craftsman.

Even the snags became teaching moments: merge conflicts, bad SSH keys, missing YAML parameters, broken navs. Ryan debugged them all, one GitHub Action at a time. Slowly, the site emerged—clean, structured, automated. A showcase of his belief in the docs-as-code philosophy: versioned, testable, CI/CD-powered content that lives in the same ecosystem as the code itself.

But this wasn’t just for him. It was for the next wave of writers he mentored—those who would step into hybrid roles, where understanding a Python function was just as important as explaining it. His mission was clear: make documentation a first-class citizen in the development lifecycle.

Today, Ryan continues that journey. He leads, he teaches, and he writes—building bridges between the technical and the human, the engineer and the end user, the script and the story.
